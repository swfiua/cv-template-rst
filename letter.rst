I am applying for the position of Senior Developer at Nephila Capital.

I have long admired Nephila as an innovative company that is leading
the way in today's challenging reinsurance market.

I am interested in all aspects of risk analysis and the development of
tools to empower people in their risk analysis work.

In my 15 years developing risk modelling systems at Renaissance
Reinsurance I was very effective balancing the needs of developing to
tight deadlines with creating a high quality and maintainable codebase.

I have continued to use my skills at Tokio Millennium Re as their Risk
Solutions Architect, designing and building their next generation of
risk systems.

I have considerable experience creating cross-platform solutions,
integrating Linux and Windows and developing component based
frameworks which allow businesses to take advantage of the best tools
available for the job.

In today's fast changing IT world systems need to be flexible and
componentised so that they can evolve in tandem with technological
advancements.  I welcome the opportunity to help develop those systems
at Nephila.

Please find my CV attached.

Many thanks.

John Gill
